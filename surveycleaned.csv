It’s not like I could have just decided to identify as male and then skipped over all the sexist bullshit. It’s insulting to present our sex to us like it’s some “identity” we can opt into or out of when a lifetime on this planet as a female woman isn’t something I ever chose. wanted or asked for. So tired of seeing gender identity ideology eroding our progress back decades with these harmful ideas that your sex can be chosen freely. or that liking certain hobbies or fashion makes someone neither male or female. Am I non binary by definition because I defy gender roles and stereotypes? And worst of all it’s impacting the usefulness of data like the ones you’re trying to collect right now because it muddies the waters.
